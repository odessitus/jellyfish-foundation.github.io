Jellysfish Foundation has the aim of providing people with places where they can *bloom*. Be it a physical space or a virtual one, our goal is to help all the right ends meet and raise awareness about the way we think the world should be - *open*.

We firmly believe in the right of everyone to choose their own fate without the tampering of external forces. This applies to the use of software, but also goes much beyond. Everyone is free to choose the software they desire, but should be able to easily access information about the consequences and implications of its' use.
